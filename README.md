This Machine Learning project predicts diseases based on the symptoms 
provided by the user. It employs three different machine learning 
algorithms: Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes, to ensure 
accurate predictions. The user interface is built using Tkinter for easy 
interaction.# Symptom-Based-Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
